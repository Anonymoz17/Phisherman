    <h1>⚠️ This Was A Phishing Test!</h1>

    <p><strong>Don't worry!</strong> This was a training exercise. No harm was done, and your information is safe.</p>

    <p>You clicked on a simulated phishing link. This test helps us identify areas where we can improve our security awareness.</p>

    <h2>🚩 Red Flags You Might Have Missed:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Suspicious sender address:</strong> Always check the actual email address, not just the display name.</li>
        <li><strong>Urgency or threats:</strong> Phishing emails often create a false sense of urgency ("Act now or your account will be closed!").</li>
        <li><strong>Unexpected links:</strong> Hover over links before clicking to see where they really go.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Tips for Next Time:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>When in doubt, don't click! Contact IT or the supposed sender directly.</li>
        <li>Look for spelling and grammar mistakes in emails.</li>
        <li>Verify requests for sensitive information through a trusted channel.</li>
        <li>Keep your security training fresh - these tests help you stay sharp!</li>
    </ul>
